  # Celluloid has the nasty side effect of making objects
  # very hard to test because they are immediately async
  # upon creation.  In testing we want to just treat
  # the actors as POROs.
  #
  # Instead of including Celluloid, we'll just stub
  # out the key methods we use so that everything works
  # synchronously.  The alternative is no test coverage.
